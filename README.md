Project name: Hierarchial Data and You!

Project Explanation:

This project is a simple Dropbox clone that will use MPTT models to enable the user to create folders and files that display in a visual tree-like structure.

Added Bonus: The user can now submit file objects from the home page, no need to use the admin panel.

Project Installation: 
Step 1. The main page should be accessible out of the box, so head on over to this link -> http://http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Step 2. Upload some files and prepare to experience the tree structure visually.

Tip! If your files are all lining up equally you may not have created an children yet. 
    a. Upload another file, 
    b. this time select a 'parent' file from the dropdown menu (this will allow you to nest your new file object under it)

Alright, you should now have your own shiny visual file tree.
Well done :)


Are you an admin and need access fast?
Step 1. run this code in the terminal:
    
        poetry install
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        python manage.py runserver

Step 2. navigate here to login with you createsuperuser credentials:

        http://http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

Hope this was helpful, 
"happy hacking".

# hierarchical-data-and-you

Sometimes when categorizing data, there are potentially infinite ways that the data can be organized. For example, a file path for an operating system includes all the parent folders and the the location of the item itself, like this:

```
/Users/jkaufeld/demo/test.py
```

If we're looking at an object called `test.py` and we want to find all of the "parent nodes", or the folders that contain this object, then we have to do a recursive call upwards. In a 'traditional' Django ORM setup, a naive example might look something like this:

```python
def get_complete_path(item):
    complete_path = list()

    while True:
        item = item.parent
        complete_path.prepend(item.path)
        if item.path == "/":
            break

    return os.path.join(complete_path)
```

This results in a database call for every single layer, which works out to three calls to get the complete path of our mythical object. We can do a lot better though... what if we could get that info in one call?

Using something called Modified Preorder Tree Traversal (MPTT), we can treat all our data like a gigantic tree, with a single starting point (the "root" object) and parents, siblings, and children galore. We can get the same data as above with a single call:

```
item.get_ancestors()
```

#### **Your Task**

The goal of this assignment is to learn about this type of database and different ways of working with it. Build a simple Django server that uses MPTT models from `django-mptt`Â to create a Dropbox-esque web interface where you can create "folders" and "files" in an arbitrary structure and then display that structure. We won't actually be uploading anything, just making model instances and using them to represent real data. See the rubric for more detailed information. Submit as link to your repo on Github.

Extra Credit:

*   3 BONUS POINTS: Add forms to create folders / "files" without using the admin panel.
*   5 BONUS POINTS: Add a basic authentication system where each user has their own tree. Login / logout pages / endpoints included.
